## *COLLECTIFY*

![banner](docs/media/banner.png)

Collectify is a simple Android application intended to display a collection list. A user can then click on a specific collection to view a list of products as well its inventory.

An exercise in the use of recyclerviews, as well as REST to fetch data (although I do not recommend using loopj in production builds and my use of nested get requests may not be ideal).
Feel free to also use it as a basic bottom navigation template.
