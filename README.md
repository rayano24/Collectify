## *COLLECTIFY*

![banner](docs/media/banner.png)


Collectify is a simple Android application intended to display a collection list. A user can then click on a specific collection to view a list of products as well its inventory.

An exercise in the use of recyclerviews, as well as REST to fetch data (although I do not recommend using loopj in production builds and my use of nested get requests may not be ideal).
Feel free to also use it as a basic bottom navigation template.

## TESTING WITHOUT ANDROID STUDIO

Simply download and install the APK file in the APK folder and install it on your device (API 21 (Lolipop) required).
You may need to enable downloads outside the play store on your devices settings.

#### Implemented with product images
